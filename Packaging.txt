///////////////////////////////////////////////
To package a block for use with this installer:
///////////////////////////////////////////////

Create a folder for your block. Copy the directory structure required under Content.
For example if you have an icon texture create the folder Textures and under it GUI followed by Icons, and so on.
Place your files in the appropriate directories after creating them.

Create a new file called Definition.xml. Paste the following text into your new xml file:

<?xml version="1.0"?>

<MyObjectBuilder_CubeBlockDefinitions xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
<Definitions>
	
</Definitions>
</MyObjectBuilder_CubeBlockDefinitions>

Copy your block's <Definition> from CubeBlocks.sbc and paste inside the <Definitions> element.

Save your Definition.xml file.

Compress your block's folder as a zip archive. Test it by launching SE-Modz Installer and dragging
it to the colored area. If your block fails to install, revisit the previous steps or come to
